# Project Name
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


## Table of Contents
1. Import the dataset
2. Check if any data cleaning is required
3. Exploratory data analysis on the data set using multivariate analysis
4. Scaling of the dataset
5. Split into test and train data
6. Sample selection using RFE
7. Modelling using multiple linear regression model
8. Analysing output  using R2 and VIF
9. Residual plotting 
10. Analysis over test data

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people.The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
AS WITH RFE , THE p values are < 0.05 and VIF is < 5 for all terms except the constant term , we are not dropping any further variable  . A descent model is derived to 
predict demand of bikes based on various variables.
Overall we have a  model, with 85 % R2
